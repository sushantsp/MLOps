In this module, you will be introduced to the definitions of and key differences between Python libraries and frameworks for application development. You will also learn about Flask, a Python-based micro framework used for web deployment of applications. The module will also introduce development and deployment concepts, including routes, request and response objects, error handling, and decorators. After building an API with Flask, you will also learn to deploy web apps using Flask.
