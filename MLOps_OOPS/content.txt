1. Class and Objects
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manully
3. Why python is called OOP ? - everthing in python object.
4. WHy OOPs ?
    > you can create your own datatypes
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to end Work on clases
    > func vs methods
    > magic method vs dunder methods
    > self - it is the object itself. object only is allowed to access to attributes and methods
    > getter and setter
        to get and set the hidden attrivute.
    > static method

Encapsulation :- You can not fully protect attributes or mthod in pyhton. __name way to encapsulate.

static methods dont require object as their argument. They are direct class methods and does not require object for them to access.
You decorate a static method with `@staticmethod` decorator.
