* this folder implements the idea of data versioning using DVC.

## How (Theory)

- Example of giving Phone wallet and bag to C! - counter
- Giving shoes on counter C2 

only with coupon required you can get your stuff back. For each set of things there is unique coupon. 

Now coming to git and DVC - First without git, you cannot use DVC. 
    - For every set of artifacts of code and other files there is a version data stored by DVC
        that has unique id associated with it. V1 -> D1
    - If we go and change the files of code. - Save it as version v2 - we got ID 2 that points to Data version 2. Basically V2 -> D2.
